<h6>Genetics Graduate Student</h6>

<h4>Biography</h4>

<p>I came to Davis in 2011 to pursue a PhD in the Genetics (now Integrated Genetics and Genomics) Graduate Group after graduating from Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA. As a joint student of Ian Korf and Michael Miller, I am in a unique position; I'm excited to be assembling and exploring the genomes of rainbow trout, Chinook, and other salmonids.</p>
